=head1 NAME

CHI::Driver::HandlerSocket - Use DBI for cache storage, but access it using the Net::HandlerSocket API for MySQL

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use CHI;

 # Supply a DBI handle

 my $cache = CHI->new( driver => 'HandlerSocket', dbh => DBI->connect(...) );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This driver uses a MySQL database table to store the cache.  
It accesses it by way of the Net::HandlerSocket API and associated MySQL plug-in:

L<http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2010/10/using-mysql-as-nosql-story-for.html>

L<https://github.com/ahiguti/HandlerSocket-Plugin-for-MySQL>

Why cache things in a database?  Isn't the database what people are trying to
avoid with caches?  

This is often true, but a simple primary key lookup is extremely fast in MySQL and HandlerSocket absolutely screams,
avoiding most of the locking that normally happens and completing as many updates/queries as it can at once under the same lock.
Avoiding parsing SQL is also a huge performance boost.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item host

=item read_port

=item write_port

Host and port the MySQL server with the SocketHandler plugin is running on.  The connection is TCP.
Two connections are used, one for reading, one for writing, following the design of L<Net::HandlerSocket>.
The write port locks the table even for reads, reportedly.
Default is C<localhost>, C<9998>, and C<9999>.

=item namespace

The namespace you pass in will be appended to the C<table_prefix> and used as a
table name.  That means that if you don't specify a namespace or table_prefix
the cache will be stored in a table called C<chi_Default>.

=item table_prefix

This is the prefix that is used when building a table name.  If you want to
just use the namespace as a literal table name, set this to undef.  Defaults to
C<chi_>.

=item dbh

The DBI handle used to communicate with the db. 

You may pass this handle in one of three forms:

=over

=item *

a regular DBI handle

=item *

a L<DBIx::Connector|DBIx::Connector> object

XXXX doesn't work

=item *

a code reference that will be called each time and is expected to return a DBI
handle, e.g.

    sub { My::Rose::DB->new->dbh }

XXXX doesn't work

=back

The last two options are valuable if your CHI object is going to live for
enough time that a single DBI handle might time out, etc.

=head1 BUGS

=item 0.9

C<t/00load.t> still referenced L<CHI::Handler::DBI> and would fail if it you didn't have it installed.  Fixed.

Tests will fail with a message about no tests run unless you run the install manuaully and give it valid DB login info.
Todo:  insert a dummy C<ok()> in there.

Should have been specifying CHARSET=ASCII in the create statement to avoid L<http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=4541>, where utf-8 characters count triple or quadruple or whatever.
Fixed, dubiously.

Huh, turns out that I was developing against L<CHI> 0.36.  Running tests with 0.42 shows me 31 failing tests.
